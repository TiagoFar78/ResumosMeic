# Dashboard

A visual display of important information consolidated on a single screen.

## KPI

KPI is a measurable value that indicates how effectively objectives are being achieved. For example, if the metric is the number of website visits he KPI is the conversion rate of visitors to customers.

A good KPI is specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-bounded.

#### Examples

- Business: Customer Acquisition Cost.
- Healthcare: Average waiting time per patient.
- Education: Student success rate per semester.

## Principles of Dashboard Design

1. Keep it simple and clear.
2. Show the most important KPIs first.
3. Use visuals effectively.
4. Avoid clutter as too many tables and graphs reduce clarity.
5. Allow interactivity where possible (filters, drill-down options, etc).
